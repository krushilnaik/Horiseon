## The How

-  The images were shrunken down to their CSS-defined max widths/heights to prevent unnecessary down-scaling.

   -  NOTE: Since this is still an assignment to be graded by a human, minification of code will be skipped

-  35% of `./assets/css/styles.css` was found to be redundant so I cut those out, consolidating elements with mostly similar properties where sensible.
   -  NOTE: Higher mobile scores (and beauty in general) can be achieved by making the site responsive, but we haven't covered that yet. I'll come back and implement this later

## Possible improvements:

-  Network analyses show an abysmal render time (~17s) on "Slow 3G" throttling. I figure this is to be expected, but if anyone can think of a way to speed this up, let me know or submit a pull request! üëç
